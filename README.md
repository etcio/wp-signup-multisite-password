Set password on WordPress Multisite Registration + Buddypress
============================

This plugin allows registrants to choose their own password during the signup process in a Buddypress compatible way.

Note: This is primarily for those running Buddypress but are using the default site signup form.

This is a variation of @khromov's [wp-signup-multisite-password plugin](https://github.com/khromov/wp-signup-multisite-password) which is a fork of [WPMUDev Set Password plugin](https://premium.wpmudev.org/project/set-password-on-wordpress-mu-blog-creation/).

### Requirements

* PHP 5.3 or higher (Due to use of anonymous functions)
* A WordPress Multisite (Single sites will not work with this plugin)
* Buddypress
